# Nero-v2
Nero-v2 is a hard coded personal assistant bot. I have used a few libraries for python to do this project. This is nowhere near complete and can be improved a lot.

Libraries used:-
1)pyttsx3
2)speech-recognition
3)webbrowser

The details on how these libraries can be used may be found online very easily. I would suggest going through the individual library documentations.
